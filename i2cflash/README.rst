I2C eeprom device drivers (pure Python)

I2C flash devices, also known as *DataFlash* are commonly found in embedded
products, to store firmware, microcode or configuration parameters.

PyI2CFlash_ comes with several pure Python drivers for those flash devices, that
demonstrate use of I2C devices with PyFtdi_. It could also be useful to dump
flash contents or recover from a bricked devices.

Notes about performances
........................

* *Read* operation is synchronous with I2C bus clock: it therefore only depends
  on the achievable frequency on the I2C bus, which is bound to the highest
  supported frequency of the flash device.
* *Write* operation depends mostly on the flash device performance, whose upper
  limit comes mostly from the maximum write packet size of the device, as the
  device needs to be polled for completion after each packet: the shorter the
  packet, the higher traffic on the I2C and associated overhead.
